    <p class="text-xl">Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which can make breathing difficult and trigger symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Asthma can range from mild to severe and can have a significant impact on a person's daily life if left untreated.

      One of the key factors that contribute to the development of asthma is genetics. Individuals with a family history of asthma are more likely to develop the condition themselves. Other factors that can contribute to the development of asthma include exposure to allergens, such as dust mites, pollen, and pet dander, as well as exposure to irritants such as smoke, pollution, and chemicals.

      Asthma symptoms vary from person to person, and is triggered by different factors. Common triggers include respiratory infections, exercise, cold air, and exposure to allergens or irritants. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.
