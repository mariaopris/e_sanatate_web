    <p class="text-xl">COPD is a chronic lung condition that makes it difficult to breathe. This disease is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, making it harder for air to flow in and out of the lungs. COPD is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse over time, and it can lead to serious complications and a decreased quality of life if left untreated.

      The most common cause of COPD is smoking, but long-term exposure to other irritants such as air pollution, dust, and chemicals can also contribute to its development. The symptoms of COPD can include shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. These symptoms can be severe and impact daily activities and overall health.

      While there is currently no cure for COPD, there are many treatment options available that can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. These can include medications, pulmonary rehabilitation, and lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise.
