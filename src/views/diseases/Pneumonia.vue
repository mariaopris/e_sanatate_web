    <p class="text-xl">Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that affects the lungs. It is caused by a variety of infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and can range from mild to severe. Pneumonia can be a life-threatening condition, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and individuals with compromised immune systems.

      The symptoms of pneumonia can vary depending on the underlying cause and the severity of the infection. Common symptoms include coughing, fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. In some cases, pneumonia can also cause confusion, especially in older adults.  Treatment options vary depending on the underlying cause of the infection, but may include antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia, antiviral medications for viral pneumonia, and supportive care such as oxygen therapy and fluids.</p>
